# @tsed/monorepo-utils

A tool to build and publish packages (Typescript or Javascript) on npm for projects based on 
mono repository [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/).

## Installation

Run:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @tsed/monorepo-utils
```

### Configuration without Semantic-release

Add these tasks to your package.json:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "",
    "version:patch": "monorepo version patch", // update version
    "version:minor": "monorepo version minor",
    "version:major": "monorepo version major",
    "build": "monorepo build packages", // build packages
    "test:e2e: "",
    "publish": "monorepo publish packages" // publish on NPM
    "docs:build": "vuepress build",
    "docs:publish": "yarn docs:build && monorepo publish ghpages",
    "heoru:publish": ""
  },
  "monorepo": {
     "ghpages": {
       "dir": "./docs/.vuepress/dist",
       "url": "https://github.com/tsedio/tsed.git",
       "branch": "gh-pages",
       "cname": "tsed.io"
     }
   }
}
```

### Configuration with Semantic-release

MonoRepoUtils is also compatible with semantic-release.

Install semantic-release and add repo.config.js file and add these lines:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  branch: 'master',
  verifyConditions: ['@semantic-release/github', '@semantic-release/npm', '@tsed/monorepo-utils/semantic-release'],
  analyzeCommits: ['@semantic-release/commit-analyzer'],
  verifyRelease: [],
  generateNotes: ['@semantic-release/release-notes-generator'],
  prepare: ['@semantic-release/npm', '@tsed/monorepo-utils/semantic-release'],
  publish: ['@tsed/monorepo-utils/semantic-release', '@semantic-release/github'],
  success: ['@semantic-release/github', '@tsed/monorepo-utils/semantic-release'],
  fail: ['@semantic-release/github'],
  npmPublish: false
}
```

Add these tasks to your package.json:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "monorepo build", // Will be called automatically semantic-release
    "release": "semantic-release"
  }
}
```

to allow git release note deployment, commit push and docker image deployment.
